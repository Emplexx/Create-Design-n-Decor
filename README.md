Quick and dirty port of Design n' Decor to work with Create 6.0.0 on 1.20.1 (the ported code is in the 1.20.1/6.0.0 branch)

Notes:

- Not really tested
- I didn't do anything about the cardboard item DnD adds despite Create now having its own cardboard (maybe i should)
- Ceiling fan and Stepped lever have alpha issues with their textures which idk how to fix
