Quick and dirty port of Design n' Decor to work with Create 6.0.0 on 1.20.1

Notes:
- Not really tested
- Since Create has its own cardboard now, I removed the Cardboard Sheet item, and Cardboard boxes are now crafted from Create's Block of Cardboard
- Ceiling fan and Stepped lever have alpha issues with their textures which idk how to fix
